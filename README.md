# 24 pin to 26 PIN FFC Adapter
24 pin 1.25mm to 26 pin 1.00mm F-F FFC Floppy Adapter

# NOTE:  THIS IS CURRENTLY IN DRAFT

## Background:

This is a FFC adapter to adapt older 24 pin 1.25mm FFC floppy systems (Korg, Tandy 1100FD, etc) to a current 26 pin 1.00mm FFC floppy drive.  The 1.25mm floppy drives were all belt driven, and the difficulty of finding belts and replacing them dictates that many people refurbishing older equipment would benefit from just swapping out the drive for a 1.00mm servo-driven floppy drive (i.e. one that doesn't need a belt).

So, I made this adapter to allow people to use their older equipmetn with a more current 1.00mm floppy drive.
